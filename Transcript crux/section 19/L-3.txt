1️⃣ What This Video Tries to Prove

A web server is just software

Tools like nginx are programs that:

Listen on a port

Receive HTTP requests

Serve files as responses

You can build a basic version yourself using Node.js

2️⃣ What You Actually Built

A custom static file server that:

Listens on a port (e.g., 3000)

Serves:

index.html for /

Other .html files for /about.html, /contact.html

Shows a 404 error if file doesn’t exist

👉 Same core job as nginx (at a basic level)

3️⃣ Core Node.js Modules Used

http → create & run server

fs → read files from disk

path → resolve file paths & extensions

4️⃣ How the Server Works (Flow)

Browser makes request → localhost:3000/...

Server listens on a port

Request arrives as req

Server decides:

Which file to serve

Or send a 404

Server sends response using res

5️⃣ Key Server Concepts Learned

http.createServer((req, res) => {})

req.url → tells which file is requested

res.writeHead() → send headers (status + content-type)

res.end() → send response body & close connection

6️⃣ File Serving Logic

/ → serve index.html

Any other URL → serve matching file

File path resolved using:

__dirname

path.join()

7️⃣ MIME Types (Important)

Server must tell browser what type of file it is sending

Examples:

.html → text/html

.css → text/css

.js → text/javascript

unknown → application/octet-stream

8️⃣ Error Handling

If file not found (ENOENT)

Send 404

Custom message like “File not found”

9️⃣ Why This Matters

You now understand:

What servers actually do

How HTTP works internally

How Node.js powers backend systems

This removes fear of backend & servers

🔟 Big Takeaway

Frameworks don’t replace understanding — they simplify it.
This video gives you the raw foundation before using tools like Express.

(Next step is Express, which abstracts all this.)
