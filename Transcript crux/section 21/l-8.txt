📁 Why Project Restructuring is Needed

Large-scale projects must be organized

Restructuring early is much easier than doing it later

Unstructured projects become hard to maintain in teams

Frameworks like NestJS enforce structure automatically

Since we are using raw Node.js, we must design structure ourselves

🎯 Goal of Restructuring

Clean, professional folder layout

Separation of concerns

Easy scalability

Industry-standard backend structure

🗂️ Standard Backend Folder Structure
Root Level
node_modules/
public/
src/
.env
package.json

🌐 public/ Folder

Purpose:

Serve static files

Structure:

public/
 └── images/
     └── .gitkeep


Used for images (instead of Cloudinary/CDN for now)

.gitkeep ensures Git tracks empty folders

🧠 src/ Folder (Main Application Code)

src acts as a wrapper for all backend logic.

src/
 ├── controllers/
 ├── db/
 ├── middlewares/
 ├── models/
 ├── routes/
 ├── utils/
 ├── validators/
 └── index.js

📌 Purpose of Each Folder
controllers/

Business logic

Functions that handle requests

Core application logic

db/

Database connection & configuration

DB operations (connect, disconnect, seed)

middlewares/

Code that runs between request and response

Auth checks

Role checks (admin, project admin, user)

Error handling

models/

Database schema / structure

Defines how data is stored

MongoDB models (later via Mongoose)

routes/

API endpoints

Maps URLs to controllers

Example: /login, /register, /projects

utils/

Reusable helper functions

Email sending

Token helpers

Common utilities

validators/

Input validation

Request data checks

Keeps controllers clean

🛠️ Creating Structure Using CLI
mkdir src
cd src
mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils validators


Create public folder:

mkdir public
cd public
mkdir images


Create .gitkeep inside images so Git tracks it.

📦 Moving Entry File

Move index.js into src/

Update package.json scripts if needed

Example:

"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}

⚠️ Important Git Note

Git does NOT track empty folders

Use .gitkeep for folders like images

Do NOT push before adding .gitkeep

✅ Final Result

Clean, scalable backend structure

Industry-standard layout

Ready for authentication, DB, APIs

Easy for multiple developers to work together
