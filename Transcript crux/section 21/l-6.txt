🔁 Problem: Constant Server Restart During Development

While building a backend project:

Every time we change a file

We must stop and restart the server manually

This slows development and becomes painful in large projects

Example problem:

Run npm run dev

Change code in index.js

Server does not update automatically

Need to rerun command again and again ❌

✅ Solution: Automatic Server Restart (Hot Reloading)

We want:

Server to auto-restart on file change

No manual stopping / starting

Faster development workflow

This is called:

Hot Reloading

Hot Restart

Watch Mode

🛠 Tools Available
1️⃣ Nodemon (Most Popular – Industry Standard)

Watches files

Automatically restarts server on change

Used in most real-world Node.js projects

2️⃣ Node Watch Mode

Built-in feature in newer Node versions

Less commonly used in industry

➡️ We use Nodemon

📦 Installing Nodemon

Install as dev dependency (not for production):

npm install --save-dev nodemon


Why dev dependency?

Used only during development

Not needed on production server

⚙️ Configuring Nodemon (Important)

Open package.json

Before:
"scripts": {
  "dev": "node index.js"
}

After:
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "start": "node index.js"
}

🧠 Difference Between dev and start
npm run dev

Uses nodemon

Auto-restarts on file changes

Used during development

npm run start

Uses node

No auto restart

Used in production

➡️ Never use nodemon in production

▶️ Running the Project
Development mode:
npm run dev

Production mode:
npm run start

🧪 Result After Setup

Server starts once

Any file change → server restarts automatically

No manual restart needed

Huge productivity boost 🚀

Example:

Change console.log("Start of backend project")

Save file

Server restarts instantly and prints updated output

🧠 One-Line Takeaway

Nodemon automatically restarts the Node.js server whenever files change, eliminating manual restarts during development.
