PROJECT CAMP BACKEND – PRD CRUX NOTES

Project Camp Backend is a Version 1 RESTful API designed for collaborative project management.
The focus of this project is backend API design, not frontend development.
It is inspired by Basecamp-style project management systems.

Purpose of the PRD:

Clearly define what needs to be built

Avoid confusion during development

Act as a single source of truth for features, roles, and permissions

TARGET USERS & ROLES (RBAC)

The system uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with three roles:

Admin

Full system access

Can create, update, delete projects

Can manage users, roles, and notes

Project Admin

Manages assigned projects only

Can manage tasks and team members within a project

Member

Can view projects

Update task status

Access assigned project information

CORE FEATURES OVERVIEW

User Authentication & Authorization

User registration with email verification

Secure login using JWT (access & refresh tokens)

Password reset and change functionality

Email verification via token

Token refresh mechanism

Role-based access control (Admin, Project Admin, Member)

Project Management

Create new projects (Admin only)

View all accessible projects with member count

View project details

Update project details (Admin only)

Delete project (Admin only)

Aggregation pipelines used for project listing

Team Member Management

Add members to projects

List project members

Update member roles (Admin only)

Remove members from projects

Task Management

Create tasks under projects

List all tasks for a project

View task details

Update task information

Delete tasks (Admin / Project Admin only)

Assign tasks to members

Track task status:

Todo

In Progress

Done

Support multiple file attachments per task

Subtask Management

Create subtasks under an existing task

Update subtasks

Delete subtasks

Track subtask completion

Subtasks removed automatically if parent task is deleted

Only Admin / Project Admin can manage subtasks

Project Notes

Add notes to projects (Admin only)

List project notes

View note details

Update notes

Delete notes

System & Utility

Health check API endpoint

Security features (CORS, validation, etc.)

File management for attachments

API STRUCTURE (HIGH LEVEL)

Base path:

/api/v1

Auth routes:

/api/v1/auth/register

/api/v1/auth/login

/api/v1/auth/refresh

/api/v1/auth/verify-email

/api/v1/auth/reset-password

Project routes:

/api/v1/projects

Task routes:

/api/v1/tasks

Note routes:

/api/v1/notes

Access to endpoints depends on user role (permission matrix defined in PRD).

DATA MODELS (INITIAL)

User roles: Admin, Project Admin, Member

Task status: Todo, In Progress, Done

Models will be refined during implementation

IMPORTANT NOTES

PRDs are intentionally detailed and overwhelming

Implementation will be done step-by-step

No assignments dumped on learners

Entire project will be built together

PRD will be referenced repeatedly during development

FINAL SUMMARY

This PRD defines a full-featured backend project management system with authentication, RBAC, project handling, task/subtask management, notes, and secure REST APIs. The document acts as a roadmap to build the entire backend incrementally and confidently.
