🚀 Getting Started with Express.js (Core Concepts)

So far, we only built project structure.
Now we start building how the application actually works.

Every backend application has two main parts:

Routing (Web Server logic)

Database interaction

In this section, we focus on routing using Express.js.

🧠 What is Express.js?

Express.js is a Node.js web application framework

It helps build web servers and APIs

It is fast, minimal, and unopinionated

Unlike frameworks like NestJS, Express does not force structure

📌 Express handles:

Routes (/login, /register, /projects)

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Request & Response handling

⚠️ NestJS vs Next.js (Important Clarification)

NestJS → Backend framework (built on Express/Fastify)

Next.js → Full-stack React framework

👉 They are completely different. Do not confuse them.

📦 Installing Express
npm install express


Express is a production dependency

Latest version installed by default

Most existing projects use Express 4.x

We are using Express 5.x (newer)

🛠 Basic Express Setup (src/index.js)
1️⃣ Import Express
import express from "express";

2️⃣ Create Express App
const app = express();


This app object gives all Express superpowers.

3️⃣ Setup Port Using Environment Variable
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;


Uses .env value if available

Falls back to 3000 if not

Best practice for production

🌐 Creating a Route
app.get("/instagram", (req, res) => {
  res.send("This is an Instagram page");
});

Explanation:

get → HTTP method

/instagram → Route

req → Request from client

res → Response sent back

▶️ Starting the Server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});


Starts server

Listens for incoming requests

Prints server URL on success

🧪 Testing the Route

Open browser:

http://localhost:8000/instagram


Output:

This is an Instagram page


📌 Route name must match exactly (case-sensitive).

🧠 Request & Response Concept

Request (req) → Data coming from client

Response (res) → Data sent back by server

Express provides many response methods:

res.send()

res.json()

res.status()

res.download()

res.redirect()

Currently using:

res.send("text")

📚 Express Core Components (High Level)

Application → app

Request → req

Response → res

Router → route handling (later)

Middleware → logic in between (later)

✅ What We Achieved in This Lecture

Installed Express

Created Express server

Used environment-based port

Created a basic GET route

Served a response to browser

🧠 One-Line Takeaway

Express.js is a routing and server framework that handles HTTP requests and responses in a Node.js backend application.
