📦 Standardizing Server Responses & Errors (Express / Node.js)

Whenever a client makes a request to a server, only two outcomes are possible:
1) Successful response
2) Error response

Something must always be sent back from the server.

🧠 Why Standardization Is Needed
If responses are not predictable:
- Frontend becomes difficult to build
- Error handling becomes messy
- Debugging becomes harder

So we standardize:
- Success responses
- Error responses

📌 What Every Response Should Contain
✔ Status code (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
✔ Data (user info, result, or null)
✔ Message (human-readable)
✔ Success flag (true / false)

Node.js already provides an Error class.
Responses, however, must be designed by us.

🟢 Standard API Response (utils/ApiResponse.js)

Used for all successful responses.

import class ApiResponse {
  constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.data = data;
    this.message = message;
    this.success = statusCode < 400;
  }
}

export { ApiResponse };

✔ Predictable structure
✔ Easy for frontend to consume
✔ No more random res.send()

---

🔴 Standard API Error (utils/ApiError.js)

Errors extend Node.js built-in Error class.

class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    statusCode,
    message = "Something went wrong",
    errors = [],
    stack = ""
  ) {
    super(message);

    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.data = null;
    this.message = message;
    this.success = false;
    this.errors = errors;

    if (stack) {
      this.stack = stack;
    } else {
      Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
  }
}

export { ApiError };

✔ Uses Node’s native Error system
✔ Captures stack traces automatically
✔ Supports multiple error messages
✔ Standard error format for frontend

---

🧪 Why This Approach Is Powerful
- Frontend always knows response shape
- Backend code becomes cleaner
- Debugging becomes easier
- Same structure across entire project
- Industry-standard pattern

---

🧠 Final Takeaway
Responses are designed by us.
Errors extend Node.js.

Standardizing both gives:
✔ Predictability
✔ Scalability
✔ Clean API contracts
✔ Professional backend architecture
