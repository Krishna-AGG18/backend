🧪 API Testing & Postman – Why and How
As backend applications grow, testing APIs via browser is not practical.

❌ Why browser is not enough
Browser only supports GET requests
Cannot send:
POST data
Headers
Auth tokens
JSON bodies
Real applications require multiple HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

👉 That’s why we use API testing tools.
🛠 API Testing Tools (Common Options)
Some popular tools:
Postman (most widely used, industry standard)
Insomnia
Thunder Client (VS Code extension)
API Insights (VS Code extension)

For this project, Postman is preferred because:
Stable
Feature-rich
Used in real companies
Easy to share collections with frontend teams

🎨 VS Code Icons (Optional but Useful)
Installing VS Code Icons:
Makes folders visually clear (controllers, routes, models, etc.)
Helps understand project structure faster
Confirms you’re following common industry folder naming
📌 Not required for functionality, but improves developer experience.

🚀 Using Postman (Step-by-Step Flow)
1️⃣ Open Postman
Sign in (optional but recommended)
Close default tabs

2️⃣ Create a Collection
Example name: Base Camp
Collections group related API requests

3️⃣ Create a Folder inside Collection
Example: test
Helps organize APIs logically (auth, users, projects later)

4️⃣ Create a GET Request
Request name: testing
URL:
http://localhost:8000
Send request → response received (e.g. Hello World)

5️⃣ Test Another Route
Example:
http://localhost:8000/instagram
Response:
This is an Instagram page

🌍 Using Environment Variables in Postman
Instead of repeating URLs:
Create a Variable
Select URL
Right-click → Set as Variable
Name: baseCamp
Scope: Global (or Collection)
Value:
http://localhost:8000
Use Variable in Requests
{{baseCamp}}/instagram
{{baseCamp}}/


✔ Cleaner
✔ Easy to change ports later
✔ Professional workflow

💾 Saving Requests
Save requests inside folders:
Home → /
Testing → /instagram
Saved requests allow:
Reuse
Sharing with frontend team
Running entire collection at once

🔁 Running APIs After Code Changes
Sometimes Postman may:
Hang
Delay response
Not update immediately

👉 Fix:
Restart server (npm run dev)
Retry request
(This is normal, Postman has become heavier over time.)

🧠 Why Postman is Important Long-Term
Used for backend testing
Helps frontend developers consume APIs
Allows:

Header testing
Token testing
Auth testing
Error testing

Postman collections act like API documentation
✅ What We Achieved in This Lecture
Understood why browser is insufficient
Learned purpose of API testing tools
Set up Postman
Created collection, folder, requests
Used environment variables
Tested Express routes professionally

🔑 One-Line Takeaway
Postman is a professional tool to test, organize, and share backend APIs beyond what browsers can do.
