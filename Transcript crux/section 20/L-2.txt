📦 SQL vs NoSQL — Single Copy CRUX
Databases exist for permanent (persistent) storage; 
memory is temporary
Core database operations = CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

SQL (Structured Query Language):
Uses a fixed schema
Data stored in tables (rows & columns) like Excel
Tables are connected using primary keys & foreign keys
Also called relational databases (RDBMS)
Best for structured, predictable data
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL (Not Only SQL):
Uses flexible schema
Data stored as documents (JSON-like objects)
Different records can have different fields
Easy to evolve data structure over time
Best for dynamic, rapidly changing data
Example: MongoDB

Key Difference:
SQL → strict structure, strong relationships
NoSQL → flexible structure, faster iteration

Types of NoSQL databases:
Document
Key-value
Column-oriented
Graph
Vector (modern use cases)

Scaling:
SQL → traditionally vertical
NoSQL → designed for horizontal scaling

Modern reality:
No database is “better”
Choice depends on use case
Line between SQL & NoSQL is increasingly blurry

Learning path in this course:
Start with NoSQL (MongoDB)
Learn through real projects, not theory
SQL understanding comes easily once concepts are clear
