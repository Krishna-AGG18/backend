🎯 CRUX — Introduction to Databases (Backend Perspective)
1️⃣ Why Databases Exist

Memory (arrays, variables) is temporary

Databases provide persistent storage (HDD / SSD)

Needed to store data permanently

2️⃣ Core Purpose of a Database

Store application data

Support CRUD operations:

Create

Read

Update

Delete

👉 Every database revolves around CRUD.

3️⃣ Types of Databases (High Level)

SQL databases

NoSQL databases (means Not Only SQL)

Other types exist (graph, vector, etc.) but not covered here

This course focuses on SQL + NoSQL only.

4️⃣ SQL vs NoSQL (Important Clarity)

SQL is not better than NoSQL

NoSQL is not better than SQL

Choice depends on:

Use case

Data structure

Application needs

Once you learn one → switching is easy.

5️⃣ Backend Data Flow
Frontend → Server → Database
Database → Server → Frontend


❌ Frontend should never talk directly to database
✅ Server processes data before DB interaction

6️⃣ Why MongoDB First

MongoDB is a NoSQL database

Data stored as objects (JSON-like)

Very natural for JavaScript developers

No separate SQL language required initially

7️⃣ ORM Layer (Very Important)

Server usually does not talk directly to database

An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) sits in between

ORM benefits:

Easier queries

Cleaner code

Better structure

Less pain with DB drivers

8️⃣ ORMs Mentioned

Mongoose → most commonly used with MongoDB

Prisma

Drizzle

This course uses Mongoose (industry standard).

9️⃣ How You’ll Learn MongoDB

No separate MongoDB-only section

Learned while building real applications

Uses MongoDB Atlas

Everything required is covered inline

🔟 Key Takeaways

Databases are essential for backend

SQL & NoSQL are use-case driven

ORM simplifies database interaction

MongoDB + Mongoose fits naturally with Node.js
